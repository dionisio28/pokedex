# React Native Pokedex

This is a **React Native** project inspired by various **Pokedex** UIs and powered by the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co) to fetch Pokémon data. Bootstrapped using the [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli), it’s built with **React Native 0.76**, **TypeScript**, **Axios**, **React Navigation**, **Styled Components**, and **React Native Vector Icons**.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

Begin by starting **Metro**, the JavaScript bundler that comes with React Native.

```bash
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start the Application
With Metro running in one terminal, open a new terminal and run your app.

For Android

```bash
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

For iOS

```bash
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
